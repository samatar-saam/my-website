      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        SafePath Youth Hub is a youth-focused initiative created to protect, guide, 
        and empower young people who are facing silent battles such as addiction, 
        peer pressure, mental health struggles, and the temptation of tahriib 
        (irregular migration).
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not a hospital or a government office. We are a safe space that 
        believes every young person deserves support, information, and hope before 
        making life-changing decisions.

      <h2>Why SafePath Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Many Gen Z youth feel stuck: no jobs, family pressure to provide, social 
        media showing “soft life”, and friends suggesting drugs or dangerous 
        journeys as the only escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        SafePath exists to show another way. We raise awareness about addiction 
        and risky migration routes, share real stories, teach safer alternatives 
        like skills training and legal opportunities, and remind every young 
        person that their life is too precious to gamble with.
