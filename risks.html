        <h2>Surviving the Desert</h2>
        <p>
          Extreme heat, dehydration, hunger, and exhaustion. Many never make it past this stage
          of the journey. Bodies are often left behind with no name, no grave, and no goodbye.Crossing the desert is one of the deadliest parts of the journey. Temperatures can rise above 45°C during the day and drop sharply at night, leaving migrants vulnerable to heatstroke, dehydration, and hypothermia. Many walk for days with little or no water, and the small amounts they carry often run out long before they reach safety. Hunger weakens the body, while the endless sand and harsh winds make every step painful and exhausting.

        <h2>Smugglers & Traffickers</h2>
        <p>
          Smugglers frequently take advantage of migrants’ desperation, promising safe passage but instead exposing them to extreme danger. Many are abused, beaten, or robbed along the journey. Smugglers may also abandon migrants in deserts, forests, or at sea when they fear being caught or when the journey becomes difficult, leaving people without water, food, or directions.

In many cases, youth and vulnerable individuals are targeted by traffickers who operate within the same routes. They may be kidnapped or deceived with false job offers, only to be forced into unpaid labour, domestic servitude, or other forms of exploitation.

        <h2>Overcrowded Boats</h2>
        <p>
          Overcrowded Boats
Small, weak boats are often packed far beyond their safe capacity. Smugglers may force people to board even when the vessel is clearly unstable. With too much weight, the boat sits low in the water, making it extremely vulnerable to high waves, strong winds, or sudden movements. If the engine fails or the weather worsens, the boat can easily capsize. In these situations, many migrants—often without life jackets—drown within minutes before rescue teams can reach them. Survivors may face severe dehydration, hypothermia, or injuries caused during the chaos of the sinking.

        <h2>Detention & Abuse</h2>
        <p>
          Many migrants are captured by authorities or armed groups and placed in overcrowded prisons, detention centers, or makeshift warehouses. These facilities often lack basic necessities such as clean water, proper ventilation, sunlight, or medical care. People are kept in dirty, cramped rooms where diseases spread quickly and privacy does not exist.

Inside these centers, migrants frequently experience beatings, verbal abuse, and humiliation. Guards or militia members may torture detainees to force confessions, demand bribes, or punish them for trying to escape. Food is often scarce, and many survive on only one small meal a day, leading to severe weight loss and malnutrition.
